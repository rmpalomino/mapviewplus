#MapViewPlus

I wrote this simple mod to make my Map View less frustrating. My computer struggles enough to run KSP, I wanted to simplify Map View a little. 

##Current Features##
* Adds a window allowing you to change focus to any maneuver nodes / celestial bodies / return to the current ship without having cycle with Tab or Shift-Tab.
* Does not lock default cycling so you can still Tab or Shift-Tab if you prefer
* Opens the Navball by default when entering Map View

##Installation##
1.  Unzip the archive.
2. Copy the MapViewPlus folder in MapViewPlus[X.X]/GameData/ to your [KSP Directory]/GameData/ folder.
3. Test it out and give me some feedback.

##Notes##
This mod should be compatible with any modified solar systems, but was only tested with [Outer Planets Mod(1.7.2)](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-1-0-3-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-7-2%29-Custom-Tekto-oceans-many-bugs-fixed-18-Jul). No favoritism or ownership implied.

Default keybindings for cycling focus are Tab (Next focus), Left-Shift + Tab (Previous Focus), Backspace (Return to Ship). Default keybinding for Navball toggle is Keypad . .

The H to the right of the MapViewPlus icon in the stock toolbar belongs to [HyperEdit v1.4.1](http://www.kerbaltek.com/hyperedit). No ownership implied.
